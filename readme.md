# jcink to proboards converter
a quick and dirty converter written in python with a touch of flask that will convert divs to attrs and CSS classes into newclass for use on proboards. 

at present it is INCREDIBLY limited, and sure to have bugs. when inputting divs, the converter only recognizes div class, so don't put in any div ID's. i made this for my own personal use!
